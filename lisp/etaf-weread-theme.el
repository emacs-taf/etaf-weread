;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The reader renders its own surface instead of borrowing the user's Emacs
;; theme, so it looks the same in every session.  `etaf-weread-color' is the
;; palette lookup used by the Views; `etaf-weread-theme-defaults' projects the
;; same palette onto the ETAF UI token contract consumed by etaf-ui Components
;; (buttons, text inputs, progress bars).
