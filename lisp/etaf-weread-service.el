;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The reader does not re-implement the WeChat Reading protocol.  It drives the
;; backend bundled under the package's `backends/' through its command line:
;;
;;   node <backend>/weread.mjs COMMAND ... --json --quiet
;;
;; Every command prints JSON.  Requests are plists such as
;; (:op :shelf :filter reading :limit 200) and every call is asynchronous:
;; CALLBACK runs later in the Emacs event loop with (:ok DATA) or
;; (:error MESSAGE :hint HINT).  Nothing here blocks, so the interface keeps
;; repainting while a request is in flight.
;;
;; Tests replace the transport by binding `etaf-weread-client-factory' to a
;; function returning a fake client, so no scenario needs the network or a
;; login.

CLIENT is a client from `etaf-weread-make-client' or a function of two

REQUEST is a plist whose `:op' selects one backend operation:

  :login     (:op :login)                               sign in / refresh it

A request may carry `:timeout SECONDS' to widen the subprocess deadline for
one call; `sync-progress' needs it because it drives the controlled browser.

CALLBACK receives exactly one of (:ok DATA), where DATA is the decoded JSON
plist, or (:error MESSAGE :hint HINT) when the command failed, timed out or
returned a backend error.  Requests run in the background, so CALLBACK may run
long after the call returns."
