;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The model owns everything a reader session remembers: the selected section,
;; the visible book rows, the keyboard selection, the book detail shown in the
;; side pane and its highlights, and the account and reading statistics.  Every
;; mutable value is an ETAF reactive source, so a View that reads it repaints
;; when a backend reply arrives; every backend request is asynchronous and its
;; reply is dropped when it belongs to a superseded load.
;;
;; The model is independent of any buffer: `etaf-weread-create' plus the public
;; actions drive a complete session headlessly, which is how the acceptance
;; scenarios exercise it with a fake client.
