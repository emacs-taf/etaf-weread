;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The application layer binds one reader model to the Views.  `etaf-weread-app'
;; is the only place that reads the model's reactive sources, so a backend reply
;; or a key press repaints the whole reader in one place, and it owns the
;; session lifecycle: the palette is provided for its subtree, the current
;; section loads on mount, and the session's timers and in-flight requests are
;; released on unmount.
;;
;; `etaf-weread-open' opens the reader as an ETAF application: the buffer, the
;; root keys, the canvas background and the window-fitting layout and page
;; size.
