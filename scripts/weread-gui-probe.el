;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The reader's layout invariants can only be checked in a real frame: the
;; model budgets its page in lines, and a row painted taller than the line
;; height silently pushes the canvas past the window.  This file is the
;; maintained probe a GUI check loads, so probes stop being throwaway files
;; that bypass the byte-compilation gate.
;;
;; Load it in a graphical Emacs, then:
;;
;;   (etaf-weread-gui-open "150x40")   ; mount the reader at a frame size
;;   (etaf-weread-gui-status)          ; one-line state for logging
;;   (etaf-weread-gui-keys "jj RET")   ; real keys through the command loop
;;   (etaf-weread-gui-check)           ; layout invariants; nil when healthy
;;
;; `etaf-weread-gui-wait' polls until the shelf arrives, which keeps a probe
;; from asserting on a loading reader.  Nothing here is part of the package's
;; public API.
