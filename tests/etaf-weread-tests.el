;;; Commentary:

;; Public behaviour tests.  Every scenario drives the reader through the
;; interfaces declared in `etaf-weread.el' with a scripted client, so no test
;; needs the network, a login or a graphical frame.  The local index scenarios
;; exercise the real SQLite backend against a temporary database file.
